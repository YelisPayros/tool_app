# Flutter Smart Tools App

This is a multi-purpose mobile application built with Flutter.  
It integrates various public APIs and features into a single, user-friendly experience.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to consume external REST APIs and present their data using clean UI design patterns, consistent color themes, gradients, and modern user interface elements.

## Features

### Age Predictor

Enter a name to estimate the probable age, display a category (young, adult, elderly), and show a representative image.

### Gender Predictor

Predicts gender based on a name. The background color and icon change dynamically to represent male or female results.

### Pokémon Search

Search for a Pokémon by name and view its sprite, name, height, and weight. The image is displayed larger for better clarity.

### University Search

Enter a country to find a list of universities with clickable web links. The list area uses blue tones to maintain design consistency.

### Rolling Stone News Feed

Loads the latest news posts from Rolling Stone’s WordPress site. The logo remains on a white background, while the link area uses a blue theme for contrast.

### Weather Screen

Displays the current weather for Santo Domingo, including temperature, wind speed, and direction. A weather icon changes dynamically based on current conditions.

### About / Hire Me Screen

Shows personal information including photo, name, email, and phone number. Uses a blue gradient background consistent with the overall design language.
